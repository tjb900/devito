    """
    A Cluster is an ordered sequence of expressions that are necessary to
    compute a tensor, plus the tensor expression itself.

    A Cluster is associated with a stencil, which tracks what neighboring points
    are required, along each dimension, to compute an entry in the tensor.

    The parameter ``atomics`` allows to specify dimensions (a subset of those
    appearing in ``stencil``) along which a Cluster cannot be fused with
    other clusters. This is for example useful when a Cluster is evaluating
    a tensor temporary, whose values must all be updated before being accessed
    in the subsequent clusters.
